## Introduction

There have been many versions of the TASS computer vision projects over the years, one being a version built on a Raspberry Pi 3 using a program based on the Tensorflow Inception V3 transfer learning example. 

The Colfax TASS Trainer replicates the transfer learning side of the original program and is trained on the Intel Nervana AI HPC Cluster (Colfax Cluster).
