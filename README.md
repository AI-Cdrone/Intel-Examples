## Introduction

The **IoT JumpWay** is an IoT platform that provides a high performance, scalable and efficient solution for IoT developers and Makers. The platform provides the fundamental services that allow you to securely distribute data from IoT devices and manage and control them securely via applications.

The platform provides an **IoT PaaS** for **IoT communication**, **tutorials** and **examples**. The **IoT JumpWay Intel® examples** provide example projects that you can use to get started using the **IoT JumpWay** for your **Intel®** IoT projects. Connect **Intel®** devices and sensors to the IoT JumpWay and control/monitor sensors/actuators and data to and from the devices.

## Intel® Movidius Examples
