# Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classifier

![Intel® Movidius](images/IDC-Classification.jpg)

## Abstract

This project shows how existing deep learning technologies can be utilized to train artificial intelligence (AI) to be able to detect invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)1 (breast cancer) in unlabeled histology images. More specifically, I show how to train a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow* and transfer learning using a dataset of negative and positive histology images. In addition to showing how artificial intelligence can be used to detect IDC, I also show how the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used in conjunction with AI to create automated systems that can be used in the medical industry.

## Projects

The IDC Classifier is made up of 3 projects that combine together to make a network:

- [IDC Classifier: Train a convolutional neural network to be able to detect positive and negative IDC](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Intel-Examples/tree/master/Intel-Movidius/IDC-Classification/IDC-Classifier "IDC Classifier: Train a covolutional neural network to be able to detect positive and negative IDC")

## DISCLAIMER

This is a project I created as an extension to one of my facial recognition projects, I advise that this is to be used by developers interested in learning about the use cases of computer vision, medical researchers and students, or professionals in the medical industry to evaluate if it may help them and to expand upon. This is not meant to be an alternative for use instead of seeking professional help. I am a developer not a doctor or expert on cancer.
