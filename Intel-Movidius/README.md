## Introduction

![IoT JumpWay Intel® Movidius Examples](TASS/images/movidius.jpg)

Intel® Movidius™ VPUs drive the demanding workloads of  modern computer vision and AI applications at ultra-low power. By coupling highly parallel programmable compute with workload-specific hardware acceleration, and co-locating these components on a common intelligent memory fabric, Movidius achieves a unique balance of power efficiency and high performance. Movidius technology allows device makers to deploy deep neural network and computer vision applications in categories such as smartphones, drones, intelligent cameras and augmented reality devices.
