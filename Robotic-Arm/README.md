## Introduction

The Computer Vision Controlled IoT Connect Robotic Arm project is a collaboration between Intel Software Innovators, TechBubble Technologies & Saft7robotics. The project allows you to create a fully functioning IoT connected robotic arm that can be controlled by a computer vision neural neural network.

The project combines 3 main projects which are as follows:

- Saft7robotics: Arduino Powered Robotic Arm
- Adam Milton-Barker: InceptionFlow
- TechBubble Technologies: TASS AI

The project consists of three programs:

- Robotic Arm Program (Arduino)
- ESP8266 Communication Program (Arduino)
- InceptionFlow Computer Vision Program (Python)

## ESP8266 Communication Program

The first step is to setup the ESP8266 communication program. You will find the [source code and tutorial](https://github.com/TechBubbleTechnologies/IoT-JumpWay-Intel-Examples/tree/master/Robotic-Arm/ESP8266 "source code and tutorial") in the [ESP8266 directory](https://github.com/TechBubbleTechnologies/IoT-JumpWay-Intel-Examples/tree/master/Robotic-Arm/ESP8266 "ESP8266 directory"). Follow the tutorial to get this part of the project set up.
